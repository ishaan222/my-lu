      <h2>My heart, in words</h2>
      <p>I love you my lauren, and today i will finally list out why and how. I know that youre the one because everyday there are always moments where i feel a connection to you even if were not talking. Whenever you feel off its like i know it without even asking , its the same otherway around. I get a feeling of pure joy i dont know how to describe it other than butterflies in my stomach whenever we talk or spend time in any way together. I know youre the one because we make eachother happy, no matter what happens. I love you because not only because you look so gorgeous and perfect to me lauren but because you taught me how to love you loved me and i learnt how to love you back, you helped me start changing myself for the better and you always supported me. I love being there whenever you need me , i love being someone you can talk to and i love your voice so much. Anytime and everytime we talk i get so excited i forget about every other worry in my world because you are my world to me lauren. I have never felt a connection like this to a single soul in my life before and i never will. I love the way you care for everyone i love your heart i love keeping you close to me i love showing you that i love you lauren, I love pushing myself to become better for you, because you as who you are is someone whos not deserved by me but i still love you to the point that even though i know you deserve someone better i want to be that better person. I love every fact about you. Your smile your pretty face and eyes your soul , your art your writing, everything lauren and i mean it. Just seeing you motivates me to do better not for myself but for us because i genuinely see a future in us lauren. Whenever we talk i get thoughts in my mind not of the current time but me thinking of ahead, our future because i know its you who i want in my life lu. 
I love you during everymood, every situation i always keep my love burning for you my lu, when were sad together or having fun together i love you during both of them. I love how you encourage me i love how you make me happy all the times. I love seeing you happy even if its due to a small thing, I love spending time with you at night , i love calling you my sweet baby as a person that used to hate people who babytime alot its ironic because babytime is my third fav time to spend with you, first being video calls , second being voice calls. I love how you notice my interests i love how you aknowledge me like nobody else, i love listening to the music you introduced me to oh lauren what do i not love about you. 

I love you my dear, i wish i could say it to your face in real life the day we meet i hug you and yell in your face telling you that i love you oh lauren i want that day to come so soon. I love how you cheer me up when anything goes wrong , i love how you see me as an ishaan that can get you anything , as an ishaan that cares about you lauren. I wish i could replace my dreams of flying across the world with you into a reality i wish i could get a genie to fulfil our dreams together lauren. I love your way of communicating , i love when you give me gifts that dont come with money but with a thought full of love,  i love writing to you i love watching movies with you i love blushing in public while im talking to you in the middle of a crowd lauren , i love having you as my girlfriend , i love being able to boast you to every person i talk to because im so proud of you. I love you i love you i love you lauren i love your eyes your hair your face i love your everything my darling. you are and will always and forever be my sweet loving dear baby.

I love you truly, you hold a place in my heart.  ðŸ©·

love,
